# This is a typical markdown file

With some descriptions over here. Maybe even with some images:

![Elephant](elephant.png)
![Elephant](giraffe.png)

**Please note: after part two of the assignment, the elephant.png and giraffe.png file should not be in the same folder any more, so you won't be able to see them in the markdown file.**
