# Circle
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) 

We are going to create a mathematical class 'Circle' that is able to store a circle and calculate the area and circumference of this circle.
In addition, it is possible to draw the circle using the SaxionApp.
- Make sure that the radius and centre coordinates (x and y) of a circle can be saved.
  - Make sure the coordinates cannot be set to a negative value.
- Provide getters and setters. The position of the circle (the coordinates) should be changeable, the radius cannot be changed after setting this initially.
- Create a method `area()` that can calculate the area of the circle (pi * radius * radius).
- Create a method `perimeter()` that can calculate the circumference of the circle (2 * pi * radius)
- Create a method `draw()` that draws the circle on the SaxionApp.

Tip: use the `Math` class in Java to do the mathematical calculations.
