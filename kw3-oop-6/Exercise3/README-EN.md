# Styles of programming
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) 
Every programming language has its own conventions for writing "pretty" code. By _conventions_ we mean certain
principles to follow while writing your code, so that it is easy to read by other programmers.

For example, when programming Java, there are the following conventions:
- Variables are always written in _camel case_.
- Class names are always written in _Pascal case_.
- Class constants (`public static final` fields) are always written in upper snake case (UPPER_CASE_LETTERS with a _ 
  between the words).

In this assignment, we are going to create our own `StringUtils` class that contains methods to convert Strings to the
different case styles used in programming. These case styles must all be implemented, for each style we have added an 
example:
- Camel case (thisIsAName, you start with a lowercase letter and then each noun is capitalized again
  written).
- Pascal case (ThisIsAName, similar to camel case, but now the first letter is also capitalized).
- Snake case (this_is_a_first_name, lowercase letters with _ (underscore) where there are spaces).
- Upper snake case (THIS_IS_A_FIRST_NAME).
- Kebab case (this-is-a-first-name, lowercase letters with - (hyphen) where there are spaces).
- L33t (th1s 1s 4 f1rst n4m3).

You can find more information about the different case styles at the relevant links.

L33t is obviously not a case style used in programming languages, but it is an internet spelling that is used
used by people who are quite familiar with IT. With L33t sp34k, you can suffice by just writing substitutions
for all the vowels.
